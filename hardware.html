							<h1>The Legend of Zelda Development Challenges</h1>

							<p>Needless to say, the original Legend of Zelda
							had plenty of issues when trying to create a game of its scale with
							such limited resources. A single screen could only display 256x240
							pixels with a maximum sprite size of 8x16. Not only this, but there
							was a maximum of only 64 sprites on screen at once; with only 8 sprites
							being on a scan line at a time.  “Sprites are two-dimensional images or animations
							overlaid into a scene. They are the non-static elements within a 2D
							game, moving independently of the background. Often used to represent
							player-controlled characters, props, enemy units, etc., sprites can
							be composed of multiple tiles or smaller sprites.”  While 64 may sound
							like a lot, it is also worth considering that this makes up all
							intractable objects in the game which are not background elements.
							This can quickly become an issue for a game like Zelda, which has
							a lot of enemies in the over world and dungeons.</p>

							<p>Aside from this issue, the concept of importing
							a map into a game is far different from today's standards. There is
							no software making it simple to sculpt a map in-game. Rather, Nintendo
							used a primitive yet very effective method to design the world of
							Zelda. They hand drew the map as shown below and would then trace
							the grid into the different screens traversable by the player.</p>

							<p>Some other criticisms the NES received was
							the design of the game cartridge port. Nintendo designed the NES
							to be more appealing to Americans with the sleek design and VCR-like
							opening to look more iconic. The detriment to this design, however,
							was that the port design would slightly bend the pins of the cartridge
							overtime. This would lead to the NES not being able to read games as
							well overtime and the rise of the infamous “blow into the cartridge”
							technique (often leading to only worsening the conditions). However,
							the issue is a mostly American problem, as Nintendo’s Japanese release,
							The Famicom, had the port facing directly upright without bending the pins.</p>

							<h1>Ocarina of Time Development Challenges</h1><br>

							<p>Taking a leap from 2D into 3D presented a whole new set of challenges
						for Nintendo to overcome. Creating a 3D space presents a lot more creative
						freedoms in terms of perspective and controls; however, many early 3d games
						found great difficulty in the sense of distance and perspective.</p>

						<p>Another issue that challenged development was the creation of polygonal
						walls surrounding the locations in Ocarina of Time. “ [According] to
						dungeon designer Eiji Onozuka [….] Link had a variety of impressive maneuvers
						but unfortunately many of his moves would cause him to "clip through walls"
						(such as the Hookshot). According to Onozuka, the mappers of Ocarina of Time,
						of which there were three, had the most trouble of the entire game, and he said
						that there would be occasions where they would actually cry.”</p>

						<img id="half" src="img/kokiri-forest.png"><br>

						<p>On the more technical side, limitations of the N64 would come to pose
						problems for graphical fidelity. The 150,000 per second polygon load of
						the N64 sounds impressive at first. Despite this, the characters themselves
						already take up roughly 400 triangles; this shows that the N64 uses every
						single one of those polys to their full potential. Texturing would also pose
						a difficult problem for modelling inside Zelda; many characters would have to
						recycle the same UV maps for different parts of the model to make it work.
						Sheik is an excellent example of ingenuity from Nintendo; the texture used on her
						arms is the same on the waist and legs.</p>

								<p>Skyward Sword was a game that faced many challenges during development.
								The game spent five years in production with two of them being experimental
								projects which ultimately failed. Alongside this long development time,
								the game suffered from franchise fatigue and a loss of identity.  With
								mixed reception from Twilight Princess, the prior Legend of Zelda
								game, Nintendo felt the need to make a game which had meaning and didn't
								feel like an obligatory release.  Having a new game director didn't help
								the cause either as the prior lead stepped down to a project manager who
								would step in at time of need. This game experimented with a vastly open
								world which was challenging to give structure. However, some ideas
								from other games began to seep into Skyward Swords identity and help the game move along.</p>

								<p>Around this time, the concept of Link flying around on a red bird
								was introduced – a method of travelling between discrete areas that
								echoed The Wind Waker’s boat excursions. Interestingly, planner Daiki
								Iwamoto mentions in the same Iwata Asks interview that Skyward Sword’s
								structure was inspired by the course selection screen in Super Mario,
								where the Italian hero could trot around and hop into whichever area
								the player chose. In fact, Aonuma suggests that this quite new,
								compartmentalised design approach for Skyward Sword may have been
								its saving grace.</p>

								<p>With a game that covers the land and sky, Nintendo needed to
								formulate a way to keep it simple but also engaging. By limiting the

								via specific locations.</p>

							<p>Breath of the Wild was, in many ways, a direct improvement
							over Skyward Sword. It took the open world experience and enhanced
							it into a fully playable world using a newer generation of consoles.
							The game had a dual release on both the Wii U and Switch, which resulted
							in a need to overhaul some designs of the game to make it work for both consoles.

							“So that idea of having a large open connected world was in my mind as
							soon as Skyward Sword was finished, really. And then the Wii U hardware
							made realising that idea a possibility.”

							“[Regarding] the Nintendo Switch version, it was spring last year
							when we made a firm decision to also release on that platform. Obviously
							that required some adjustments to the development process and changes
							to be made, and to continue developing the Wii U version alongside
							Nintendo Switch, that was spring last year.”

							“Of course on Wii U you have two screens - the main screen, and
							one on the GamePad - but the Nintendo Switch has one screen. That was a
							major change, but we achieved it a lot more easily and quickly than we expected.”</p>

							<img id="half" src="./img/botw-openworld.jpg"><br>

							<p>Another technical marvel for the game was its ability to use a physics
							engine to solve puzzles, this new form of interaction with the game world
							was never before seen in the Zelda franchise.  “Another example of a
							challenge we faced was the physics engine. We wanted a consistent
							physics engine throughout the world that worked in a logical and realistic
							way.” “The way the physics engine underpins everything in the world really
							offers up a lot of new possibilities. For instance, in Breath of the Wild
							you might have a puzzle where making use of the physics, there'll be
							various ways you can solve that puzzle.”</p>
