		<h1>The Legend of Zelda Deep Dive</h1>

		<p data-aos="fade-up">Welcome to The Legend of Zelda Informative Deep Dive.
			We are here to give some insight into The Legend of Zelda franchise and
			how they have continued to evolve over the years. By proxy, we hope this
			presentation will show how Nintendo has too adapted as a company and
			continues to innovate their games' formula in ways few other developers have.</p>

							Like Nintendo, Zelda has not been afraid to innovate upon the
							formula while also not straying too far from the core mechanics
							players have come to love. With each game the franchise truly

							of the franchise and highlight what benefits they have brought.</p>

								<h1>The Legend of Zelda</h1>
								<p>The Legend of Zelda was released on February 21, 1986. The game
								was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System.<br><br>

								The game focuses the quest of our character, Link who is tasked with
								finding eight fragments of The Triforce of Wisdom. Follow Link as
								he travels the lands of Hyrule to save the kingdom from the evil
								clutches of Ganon and his army of darkness.<br><br>

								We chose this game as it being the first game of the
								franchise meant that it would lay the groundwork for all
								games to come after. The original Zelda established many of
								the elements of subsequent games, including dungeons, puzzle
								solving, item gathering and returning characters.
								It also displays the impressive innovation of Nintendo
								as they had to work around the NES visual limitations.</p>

								<h1>Ocarina Of Time</h1>
								<p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was released on November 21, 1998.
								The game was released on the Nintendo 64.<br><br>

								In this game, a reincarnation of Link is raised in Kokiri Village
								by an ancient tree known as The Great Deku Tree. This elder tree is
								cursed by Ganondorf a mysterious man vying for power in the lands
								of Hyrule. Link defeats the curse of the tree but is unable to save
								it from dying. Before passing, the tree tells Link the story of
								Ganondorf (Ganon’s reincarnation) and the Triforce; Link is instructed
								to find Princess Zelda and stop Ganondorf’s conquest for power
								before its too late.<br><br>

								We chose this game because it was a technological marvel for Nintendo
								as it was The Legend of Zelda’s first entry into 3D. It introduced many
								of the mechanics new 3D Zelda games use, and set up many of the factions/essential
								characters who would play an important role going forward. Most notably, this
								game is responsible for the multiple timelines that exist in the Zelda universe
								and the stories of the other game’s narratives.</p>

								<h1>Skyward Sword</h1>
								<p>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword was released on November 18
								to November 24 2011 depending on the region. The game was released on the Wii.<br><br>

								‘After a tumultuous ceremony, Link and his childhood friend Zelda get
								caught in a mysterious tornado while flying their Loftwings, with Zelda
								disappearing and Link being thrust aside. It is eventually found that
								Link must undergo a quest to the mysterious surface to rescue Zelda
								from the clutches of an ancient evil, all the while wielding and improving
								a mystical sword granted to him from the skies by the goddess Hylia.’<br><br>

								We chose this game because it embodied a new generation of consoles and
								game design for Nintendo. It was the first Zelda game to implement motion
								controls (a mechanic involving physical movement of the controller to
								impact in game actions) albeit the controls have not aged well. However,
								it did mark a new point in Nintendo’s desire to innovate the formula by
								more directly involving the player. This in turn strengthens the LINK
								between the player and character. The game also plays a significant role
								in the universes' story as Skyward Sword is the first chronological game
								of the franchise, and explains much of the lore behind the game’s story.</p>

							<h1>Breath Of The Wild</h1>
							<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was released on March
							3, 2017. The game was released on the Wii U and the Nintendo Switch simultaneously.<br><br>

							‘Link awakens from a deep slumber and a mysterious voice guides him
							to discover what has become of the ruined Kingdom of Hyrule Kingdom.
							Link learns from King Rhoam that 100 years prior, a great evil known
							as the Calamity Ganon rose up and laid waste to the kingdom and its
							people. Unable to be defeated, it was sealed within Hyrule Castle,
							while the ruins of the land were ravaged by nature over time. Although
							trapped, the Calamity Ganon has grown in power, and Link must defeat
							it before it breaks free once more and destroys the world. As Link
							sets off on his quest to defeat Calamity Ganon, he is asked to investigate
							the fate of the Divine Beasts and their former Champions. His ultimate
							goal, however, remains to reach the Calamity Ganon and free the trapped
							Zelda before the whole world is laid to waste.’<br><br>

							We chose this game because it set a new era for Zelda, where all timelines
							converged to a singularity. The reset created a fresh slate for Nintendo to
							work with which allowed for a very different kind of Zelda. This game added a
							lot of new mechanics for the Zelda franchise (many utilized motion controls as
							well but in a far less frustrating manner) It was also the flagship game for the
							Nintendo Switch, the newest line of consoles.</p>
