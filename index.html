		<h1>The Legend of Zelda Deep Dive</h1>

		<p data-aos="fade-up">Welcome to The Legend of Zelda Informative Deep Dive.
			We are here to give some insight into The Legend of Zelda franchise and
			how they have continued to evolve over the years. By proxy, we hope this
			presentation will show how Nintendo has too adapted as a company and
			continues to innovate their games' formula in ways few other developers have.</p>

								<h1>The Legend of Zelda</h1>
								<p>The Legend of Zelda was released on February 21, 1986. The game
								was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System.<br><br>

								The game follows the quest of our character, Link as he travels the
								lands of Hyrule to save the kingdom, alongside Princess Zelda, from
								the evil clutches of Ganon and his army of darkness. Link is tasked
								with finding eight fragments of The Triforce of Wisdom, which were
								 scattered in eight dungeons by Zelda before her capture. Upon
								conquering the eight dungeons, Link uses the Triforce of Wisdom,
								alongside a silver arrow, to defeat Ganon and save the kingdom.<br><br>

									We chose this game as it being the first game of the
									franchise meant that it would lay the groundwork for all
									games to come after. The original Zelda established many of
									the elements of subsequent games, including dungeons, puzzle
									solving, item gathering and returning characters.
									It also displays the impressive innovation of Nintendo
									as they had to work around the NES visual limitations.</p>

								<h1>Ocarina Of Time</h1>
								<p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was released on November 21, 1998.
								The game was released on the Nintendo 64.<br><br>

								In this game, a reincarnation of Link is raised by an ancient tree
								known as The Great Deku Tree. This elder tree is cursed by a reincarnated
								Ganon (Ganondorf) a man vying for power in the lands of Hyrule. Link
								defeats the curse of the tree but is unable to save it from dying.
								Before passing, the tree tells Link the story of Ganondorf and the
								Triforce; Link is instructed to find Princess Zelda. Link meets with
								Zelda and is told about a dream of spiritual stones. After going
								on a quest to retrieve the stones, Link returns to Hyrule Castle
								only to find it overthrown by Ganondorf. Link, armed with The Ocarina
								of Time, (a magical object given to Link by Zelda when she fled the
								castle.) travels to the Temple of Time and retrieves the Master Sword.
								He falls asleep for seven years, awakening to the dark future made by
								Ganondorf. Link is met by a sage of light who instructs him to awaken
								five other sages to become the hero of time. After acquiring a medallion
								(forged by the six sages) he is met by Sheik, a mysterious warrior
								who reveals herself to be Zelda. Link is gifted light by Zelda but is
								captured by an empowered Ganondorf. Link races to Ganondorf’s castle
								and wins a duel that results in the castle collapsing. Link, alongside
								the seven sages, confront a transformed Ganondorf simply called Ganon.
								After defeating him, Link is sent back in time to when he was a child.<br><br>

								We chose this game because it was a technological marvel for Nintendo
								as it was The Legend of Zelda’s first entry into 3D. It introduced many
								of the mechanics new 3D Zelda games use, and set up many of the factions/essential
								characters who would play an important role going forward. Most notably, this
								game is responsible for the multiple timelines that exist in the Zelda universe
								and the stories of the other game’s narratives.</p>

								<h1>Skyward Sword</h1>
								<p>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword was released on November 18
								to November 24 2011 depending on the region. The game was released on the Wii.<br><br>

								In this game, the original Link (for the time being) lives upon the Skyloft,
								a floating island of the last humans. The village is reliant upon large
								birds known as Loftwings and praise a goddess who has protected them
								from the surface below. Link participates in a race to win a prize
								from Zelda, the village headmaster's daughter. After winning the race,
								Link is given the sailcloth by Zelda. After riding off on their
								loftwings, a tornado from the surface knocks Zelda away.  Link jumps
								after her, but he is grabbed by a mysterious woman who is later
								revealed to be Fi. Link is gifted the goddess sword and an emerald
								tablet. This tablet opens a hole in the sky revealing the land below;
								together, Link and Fi travel to the surface in order to find Zelda.
								Upon the surface, Link explores Skyview Temple and encounters a demon
								called Ghirahim who rules over the surface. Ghiraham tests Link’s
								abilities before leaving to pursue Zelda. Link spends a majority of
								the game uncovering the truth behind the world and why they lived in
								the clouds. Eventually, Link makes it to the earth temple. Link
								reunites with Zelda who is accompanied by Impa (another recurring
								character in the franchise who is Zelda’s guardian) Link completes the
								Triforce and defeats Demise (a primordial evil who reincarnates as Ganon).
								Upon his victory, Link frees Zelda (the mortal incarnation of the goddess
								Hylia) from having to imprison Demise for centuries. Ghiraham then reappears,
								grabbing Zelda and relaying his plans to revive Demise through the Gate of Time.<br><br>

								We chose this game because it embodied a new generation of consoles and
								game design for Nintendo. It was the first Zelda game to implement motion
								controls (a mechanic involving physical movement of the controller to
								impact in game actions) albeit the controls have not aged well. However,
								it did mark a new point in Nintendo’s desire to innovate the formula by
								more directly involving the player. This in turn strengthens the LINK
								between the player and character. The game also plays a significant role
								in the universes' story as Skyward Sword is the first chronological game
								of the franchise, and explains much of the lore behind the game’s story.</p>

							<h1>Breath Of The Wild</h1>
							<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was released on March
							3, 2017. The game was released on the Wii U and the Nintendo Switch simultaneously.<br><br>

							In this game, another reincarnation of Link awakens inside the temple of resurrection
							and is led to the surface by a mysterious voice. Link exits the temple to discover a
							ruined Hyrule. Link encounters an old man who gifts link a paraglider in exchange for
							four orbs Link must recover. After obtaining the orbs, Link is instructed to meet the
							old man in the Temple of Time. The old man reveals himself as the deceased king of
							Hyrule and tells Link of the tragedy that occurred. They explain 100 years prior a great
							evil known as calamity ganon had been sealed inside Hyrule Castle due to it being
							unbeatable. Link then travels to a sheikah village led by a wise, elderly Impa. Link
							is told about the Guardians and Divine Beats, ancient machines built long ago and
							used by a previous hero and princess to stop Calamity Ganon. Link is tasked to
							investigate the divine beasts (now controlled by Ganon) and discover the fates of
							the four champions who had controlled them. (each an essential character in the
							games plot) Link reclaims control over the divine beats and sets free the souls
							of the former champions trapped by the machines. After traveling to the lost
							woods and recovering the master sword, Link returns to Hyrule castle to combat
							Ganon. Using a combination of  the master sword, alongside the divine beasts power
							and Zelda’s bow of light; Link defeats Ganon and Zelda is able to seal Ganon away.
							The lost spirits trapped by Ganon are set free and the world is at peace.<br><br>

							We chose this game because it set a new era for Zelda, where all timelines
							converged to a singularity. The reset created a fresh slate for Nintendo to
							work with which allowed for a very different kind of Zelda. This game added a
							lot of new mechanics for the Zelda franchise (many utilized motion controls as
							well but in a far less frustrating manner) It was also the flagship game for the
							Nintendo Switch, the newest line of consoles.</p>
