							<h2>Overworld</h2>
							<p>Most other games would focus on getting high scores but in The
							Legend of Zelda game during it’s time it created a new kind of
							gameplay and allowed players to be able to save their progress
							to later resume playing where they left off.  The gameplay is mainly
							just exploring the overworld in a top view perspective fighting
							monsters, collecting rupees to buy useful
							items and upgrading weapons in shops, finding secret location to collect
							items and finding all 8 locations of the dungeons (The Eagle, The Moon, The Manji,
							The Snake, The Lizard, The Dragon, The Demon, The Lion) to beat.  Because
							the game is nonlinear it allows players to freely go where they want
							in the overworld and complete the dungeons in any order because you
							need to collect all 8 pieces of the Triforce in order to
							enter Death Mountain to defeat Ganon.</p><br>

							<p>When you enter a dungeon it’s a labyrinth with many rooms filled
							with monsters and useful items to collect but sometimes you’re unable
							to beat a dungeon if they don’t have a specific item to continue
							going forward.  Some rooms you can avoid fighting enemies and go to
							the next room but sometimes you have to kill all the enemies to
							collect a small key to open a door.  Each dungeon provides a compass
							to help show the player the location of the piece of Triforce, a
							dungeon map showing the layout of the rooms of how it’s connected,
							and a new item to use.  When you beat the boss of the dungeon they
							drop a heart container optioninal for the player to collect to
							increase their health.  Once you collect one of the pieces of the
							Triforce you exit the dungeon and appear in front of the entrance
							and continue to find the other dungeons.</p>

							<img id="half" src="./img/dungeon1.png">

							<p>Second Quest is unlocked when you beat the game or when you enter
							the name “ZELDA” as the player’s name.  During the Second Quest the
							game is more difficult for players wanting a more challenging experience.
							The difference is the location of the Dungeons and items are located in
							different areas making the player be able to re-experience exploring
							the overworld to find them while fighting even stronger enemies.</p>

									<p>Because Ocarina of Time is the first game in the series to use
									3D graphics Nintendo included a new mechanic Z-targeting when pressing
									the Z trigger it locks onto an enemy or object and the camera follows
									the target to make Link face it.  When there is no target to lock on
									when pressing the Z the camera would just lock Link into facing the
									direction he’s in to help have a reliable control of the camera in 3D space.
									Z-Targeting is an important innovation that is used in many 3D combat games.</p>

									is a child and Hyrule has some dangers and has to collect 3 Spiritual
									Stones to open the door to the Sacred Realm.  Young Link can’t change
									tunics, boots, or swords because they are adult size, or use any weapons
									that adult Link can use but can crawl into small areas.
									In the future Link is an adult and Hyrule is plagued by curses and
									has to free five temples from Ganondorf’s control and awaken each temple
									sage to help seal Ganondorf in the Dark Realm. Adult Link can change his
									tunics to survive high temperatures, and breathe underwater, use iron boots
									to walk underwater, and use hover boots to walk on air for a short time.
									Only adult Link can ride Epona across Hyrule because Epona is old enough
									to carry Link.  Changing between the present and future is caused by putting or
									taking the Master Sword.  Most of the change of switching is mainly
									the weapons and equipment Link can use.  The overworld is the same,
									just the look is different.</p>

							<p>Nintendo always tries to do something unique for The Legend of
							Zelda games and for Skyward Sword it heavily uses Motion Controls to
							allow players to experience wielding a sword to fight enemies.
							Skyward Swords require players to use a Wii Remote Plus that has a built
							in motion control or a Wii Motion Plus attached to your Wii Remote while
							also using a nunchuck attached to the Wii Remote.  The Wii Remote serves
							as Link’s sword and the Nunchuck as the shield during your adventures.
							Raising the Nunchuk causes Link to raise his shield up in order to block
							enemy’s attacks and to reflect enemy’s projectiles to them.  Because the
							shield can be damaged from enemy attack, players have to think of more
							strategic ways to defend against the enemy than relying too much on the
							shield to protect Link because if it breaks you’ll have to buy a new one or
							repair it.  Skyward Strike is caused when the player raises the Wii Remote
							up in the air to cause the sword to charge up and when it’s finished charging,
							swinging the Wii Remote down to release a beam as a projectile attack and can
							trigger environmental elements like magical switches.</p>

									<p>A new function was introduced, the stamina gauge allowing Link to
									be able to sprint and dash up walls, and use for sword attacks but
									the meter decreased quickly, limiting Link’s movement instead of
									him being able to perform these actions for an infinite amount of time.
									If the meter is drained, Link becomes exhausted for a while, unable to
									use any weapons or items until the gauge is refilled and during battles
									it leaves Link defenseless.  When stamina isn’t used it will slowly
									refill and completely refill when Link collects a Stamina Fruit.</p>

									<p>The sailcloth allows Link to safely land on the ground to avoid fall damage.
									The sailcloth only goes straight down and doesn’t allow the player to steer in

									sailcloth to ride the winds to reach higher areas.</p>

							<p>There are some people who enjoy the motion control to swing a sword
							to play but some people don't like that Skyward Sword is heavily motion controlled.
							Nintendo is going to re-release Skyward Swords HD for the Switch on July 16, 2021.
							Allowing players to choose their experience in how to play by using a controller
							to press buttons or to use joycons for motion control to still experience
							swinging a sword like in the Wii. </p>

									the player can use their weapon to hit the object or monster
									causing it to gain kinetic energy. Once time runs out the object
									or monster will be affected by the stored kinetic energy. The
									strength and direction are shown by an arrow. This rune is useful
